# Health Check Implementation - Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Health Check Infrastructure

Created two custom health check classes following ASP.NET Core health check patterns:

**`Health/DatabaseHealthCheck.cs`**
- Validates PostgreSQL connectivity using `CanConnectAsync()`
- Detects pending migrations
- Returns detailed health data (connection status, migration count)
- Implements proper error handling and logging

**`Health/IdentityServerHealthCheck.cs`**
- Validates IdentityServer configuration
- Tests discovery document generation
- Confirms operational readiness
- Handles IdentityServer-specific errors

---

### 2. Health Endpoints

Added three production-ready endpoints to `Program.cs`:

**`/health`** - Comprehensive health check
- Returns detailed JSON with all check results
- Includes status, timestamp, duration, and custom data
- HTTP 200 (Healthy) or 503 (Unhealthy)
- Use for: Monitoring dashboards, debugging

**`/health/ready`** - Readiness probe
- Checks only "ready"-tagged health checks
- Lightweight JSON response
- Use for: Kubernetes readiness, load balancers

**`/health/live`** - Liveness probe
- No actual checks (fastest response)
- Returns 200 OK if process is alive
- Use for: Kubernetes liveness, deadlock detection

---

### 3. Program.cs Updates

**Services Registration**:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddCheck<DatabaseHealthCheck>(
        name: "database",
        tags: new[] { "db", "postgres", "ready" })
    .AddCheck<IdentityServerHealthCheck>(
        name: "identityserver",
        tags: new[] { "identityserver", "ready" });
```

**Endpoint Mapping**:
```csharp
app.MapHealthChecks("/health", new HealthCheckOptions { ... });
app.MapHealthChecks("/health/ready", new HealthCheckOptions { ... });
app.MapHealthChecks("/health/live", new HealthCheckOptions { ... });
```

---

### 4. Documentation

**`docs/HEALTH_CHECKS.md`**
- Complete guide to all health endpoints
- Response format examples
- Docker and Kubernetes integration patterns
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices

**`test-health.sh`**
- Automated testing script
- Tests all three endpoints
- Checks Docker container health status
- Shows recent health check logs
- Color-coded output for easy reading

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Start the application

```bash
# Build and start containers
docker-compose up -d --build

# Wait for startup (60s grace period)
sleep 60
```

### Step 2: Run automated tests

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x test-health.sh

# Run tests
./test-health.sh
```

### Step 3: Manual endpoint testing

```bash
# Full health check with formatted JSON
curl http://localhost:5000/health | jq

# Readiness check
curl http://localhost:5000/health/ready | jq

# Liveness check (no body)
curl http://localhost:5000/health/live
```

### Step 4: Verify Docker health

```bash
# Check container health status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

# View detailed health logs
docker inspect pipster-identity | jq '.[0].State.Health'
```

## 📊 Expected Responses

### Healthy System

**`/health` Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "Healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T14:30:00Z",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "database",
      "status": "Healthy",
      "description": "Database is healthy",
      "duration": 45.3,
      "data": {
        "database": "PostgreSQL",
        "connection": "healthy",
        "pending_migrations": false
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "identityserver",
      "status": "Healthy",
      "description": "IdentityServer is healthy",
      "duration": 12.7,
      "data": {
        "identity_server": "operational",
        "discovery_endpoint": "healthy"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**`/health/ready` Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "Healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T14:30:00Z"
}
```

**`/health/live` Response**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
(empty body)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Health check returns 503

**Cause**: Database connection failed

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Check database connectivity
docker exec pipster-postgres psql -U postgres -d pipster_identity_dev -c "SELECT 1"

# Review connection string in docker-compose.yml
docker-compose config | grep ConnectionStrings
```

---

### Issue: Container keeps restarting

**Cause**: Health check failing after startup

**Solution**:
```bash
# View startup logs
docker logs pipster-identity

# Temporarily disable healthcheck to debug
docker-compose up -d --no-healthcheck

# Test health endpoint manually
docker exec pipster-identity curl http://localhost:80/health
```

---

### Issue: Pending migrations warning

**Cause**: Database schema not up to date

**Solution**:
```bash
# In development, migrations auto-apply on startup
# Check logs for migration status
docker logs pipster-identity | grep -i migration

# Manually apply migrations if needed
docker exec pipster-identity dotnet ef database update
```

## 🎯 Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Health endpoints return 200 OK
- [ ] Database health check passes
- [ ] IdentityServer health check passes
- [ ] Docker healthcheck working (see `docker ps` STATUS column)
- [ ] Liveness probe configured in orchestrator
- [ ] Readiness probe configured in orchestrator
- [ ] Health check timeout appropriate (30s recommended)
- [ ] Grace period configured (60s minimum)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured for health failures
- [ ] Health check logs sent to centralized logging

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

Now that health checks are implemented, you can proceed with:

### Option A: `.dockerignore` Optimization
- Reduce build context size
- Improve build performance
- Already has basic .dockerignore, enhance it

### Option B: `.env` File for Environment Variables
- Externalize configuration
- Improve security (no hardcoded passwords)
- Environment-specific settings

### Option D: Complete Documentation
- README.md with quick start guide
- Architecture diagrams
- Deployment instructions
- API documentation

**Recommendation**: **Option B** (`.env` file) is most critical next:
- Currently using hardcoded `postgres/postgres` credentials
- Production requires secure credential management
- Aligns with your security/compliance requirements
- Enables different configs per environment
