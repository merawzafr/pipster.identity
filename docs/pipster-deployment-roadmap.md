- Memory > 85% consistently
- Response time degrading
- Can afford it (infra < 10% of revenue)

**NO if:**
- Current server handles load fine
- Cost would be > 15% of revenue
- Can optimize current setup instead

### Should I Migrate to Azure?

**YES if:**
- Revenue > $5,000/month
- Need SOC2/compliance
- Want enterprise features
- Can afford $200+/month

**NO if:**
- Revenue < $2,000/month
- Hetzner works well
- Want to maximize profit margin
- Don't need Azure-specific features

### Should I Add Another Server?

**YES if:**
- Single server at capacity
- Need database isolation
- Want high availability
- Can afford additional cost

**NO if:**
- Can vertically scale current server
- Usage doesn't justify cost
- Can optimize existing setup
